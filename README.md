### [](#whats-the-dom)What's the DOM
*   The [DOM (Document Object Model)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction) is the in-memory representation of a browser's web document.
*   It's a tree-like data structure with the top (root) being the `document` object.
*   Let's type `document` in DevTool's console and explore some of its properties.
*   The DOM's application programming interface ([API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)) enables developers to make the UI dynamic by using JavaScript to:
    *   Add/remove elements to/from the document
    *   Change the content of elements
    *   Change the style properties of elements

### [](#setup)Setup
*   Move to a new directory
*   Create a folder named `dom-practice` and `cd` into it.
*   Touch an `index.html` and open the directory in vscode `code .`
*   in the `index.html` use the `! [tab]` to create the HTML boilerplate.
*   Make a `js` folder and touch a `js/script.js` file.
*   Add a `<script>` tag to include `script.js` in the `<head>`:
    
        <head>
          ...
          <title>DOM Practice</title>
          <script defer src="js/script.js"></script>
        </head>
    
*   The `defer` attribute ensures the DOM is ready before the script executes.
*   Finally, let's add an `<h1>` inside of the `<body>` as follows:
    
        ...
        <body>
          <h1 id="title" class="main-title">DOM Practice</h1>
        
        </body>
        </html>
    
*   Note: It's a best practice to use double quotes and  
    kebob-casing in the HTML.
    
### [](#using-devtools-to-explore-the-dom)Using DevTools to Explore the DOM
*   First let's install the **open in browser** VS Code extension so that we can open HTML pages in the browser a keyboard shortcut of `option-b`.
*   After `index.html` is opened in Chrome, use the keyboard shortcut of `option-command-i` to open Chrome's DevTools.

### [](#using-devtools-to-explore-the-dom-1)Using DevTools to Explore the DOM
*   Click on the **Elements** tab to browse the DOM.
*   To try it out, first select the `h1` element and use the **Styles** panel to add a CSS property of `color: red;`

### [](#using-devtools-to-explore-the-dom-2)Using DevTools to Explore the DOM
*   Look closely after the closing `</h1>` tag - you see that _`== $0`_?
*   That tells us that Chrome has created a variable named `$0` that represents the `<h1>` element in the DOM!
*   Click on the **Console** tab and let's explore the properties on the `$0` object by typing `dir($0)`.
*   Now try typing this in: `$0.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow'`
*   Now that's what I call a DOM!

### [](#selecting-dom-elements)Selecting DOM Elements
*   Web devs make web pages dynamic by manipulating the DOM.
*   For example, in a To Do app, the user types a new todo into an input, clicks a button and the new todo is added to the list.
*   The above scenario requires the app's JS to:
    *   Attach an event listener to the button element
    *   Grab the text entered from the `input` element
    *   Create a new element, e.g. an `li`, and set it's content
    *   Append the new element to its parent element
*   Devs must use JS to select DOM elements so that the above steps can be performed!

### [](#select-a-single-element-by-its-id)Select a single element by its _id_
*   The `getElementById` method is the most efficient way to select a DOM element if it has an `id` assigned to it.
    
        let titleEl = document.getElementById('title');
        console.log(titleEl);
    
*   Note that, unlike we do in CSS, we do not put a # in front of the `id` when using `getElementById`.
*   If you'd like to be able to explore the properties of element, use `console.dir()` instead.
*   But what if the element doesn't have an id...

### [](#select-a-single-element-using-abrcss-selector)Select a single element using a CSS selector
*   The solution is to use the `querySelector(selector)` method that is available on the `document` object (and elements themselves).
*   The _selector_ argument is a string that follows the rules of regular CSS3 selectors.
*   The CSS3 selector language offers amazing power to target elements for selection!
*   Knowing that the _selector_ provided to `querySelector(selector)` follows the rules of CSS3 selectors, **how could we modify our code to select our `<h1>` element by its id?**
*   If the CSS selector provided to `querySelector()` matches multiple elements, it returns the **"first"** matching element.
*   If no matching node is found, `null` is returned.

### [](#-practice)üí™ Practice
*   In _index.html_, add a `<p>` tag below the `<h1>` and give it a class of _cool_, then...
*   Add some content inside of the `<p>` tag - try typing `lorem [tab]` to emit (using _emmet_) random _lorem ipsum_ text.
*   Use `querySelector()` to select the first element with a class of _cool_ and assign it to a variable named `pEl`.
*   **Verify that the `<p>` element was selected by logging out `pEl`.**

### [](#change-the-content-of-an-element)Change the content of an element
*   Now that we're able to select an element of our choosing, let's see how we can change the content of that element.
*   By inspecting the properties of a DOM element in the console, we will find a couple of properties that we can use to read and set its content:
    *   **`innerHTML`** - Used to retrieve/set content as HTML
    *   **`textContent`** - Used to retrieve/set content as plain text
*   Let's check out changing the content of the `<p>` element by assigning the string **`Comments for <strong>Today</strong>`** first to `textContent`, then to `innerHTML`.
*   So, as you saw, if you want to include HTML in the content, use `innerHTML`.
*   The power of `innerHTML` may not be obvious, but consider the string can be as complex as you want - containing multiple elements with attributes, etc.
*   However, using `textContent` is more efficient if just setting text.

### [](#change-the-style-of-an-element)Change the style of an element
*   DOM elements have a `style` property that can be used to set CSS styling!
*   Check out the CSS properties in the console.
*   **What naming convention is used for CSS properties in the DOM?**
*   **What naming convention is used for CSS properties in CSS?**
*   **Why is it different?**

*   This is how we can set the `text-align` CSS property of our title:
    
    let titleEl = document.getElementById('title');
    titleEl.style.textAlign = 'center';
    
*   üí™ **Your turn:** Change the `color` of the `<p>` element to a color of your choosing.

### [](#attributes-of-an-element)Attributes of an element
*   You may need to get, set, or check if an element has a certain _attribute_.
*   Here are a few of the methods that the [Element API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/element) (Application Programming Interface) has for working with an element's attributes:
    *   `getAttribute(name)`
    *   `setAttribute(name, value)`
    *   `hasAttribute(name)`

### [](#attributes-of-an-elementbr-practice-5-mins)Attributes of an element  
üí™ Practice (5 mins)
*   Add an `<a>` tag to `index.html` with content of "Visit Google" but **without an `href` attribute**.
*   Reload the page and verify that the link does not work (in fact, it probably doesn't even look like a link).
*   In the JS, write the line of code that will add an `href` attribute that will make the link navigate to "[https://www.google.com"](https://www.google.com%22).
*   Hint: Check out the previous slide

### [](#attributes-of-an-element---classes)Attributes of an element - Classes
*   Technically, you could use those attribute methods we saw to work with an element's classes.
*   However, the `classList` property offers a better approach. It's an object with the following methods pertaining to classes:
    *   `add(className, className, ...)`
    *   `remove(className, className, ...)`
    *   `toggle(className)`
    *   `contains(className)`
    *   `replace(oldClass, newClass)`

### [](#-review-questions)‚ùì Review Questions
*   **If we want to change the text (no HTML) inside of a `<div>`, what property should we set?**
*   **How many DOM elements are returned by the `querySelector` method?**
*   **What DOM element property is used to style a DOM element?**

### [](#selecting-multiple-elements)Selecting multiple elements
*   Before we checkout selecting multiple elements, let's add the following HTML below the existing `<p>` element:
    
        <ul id="comments">
          <li class="comment">first comment</li>
          <li class="comment">second comment</li>
          <li class="comment">third comment</li>
        </ul>
    
*   VS Code includes [Emmet](https://docs.emmet.io/abbreviations/syntax/), which is a great tool for quickly generating markup. Type the following to generate most of the markup above:  
    `ul#comments>li.comment{comment}*3`

### [](#selecting-multiple-elements-1)Selecting multiple elements
*   The following methods _can_ be used to select multiple elements:
    *   `getElementsByTagName(namesString)`
    *   `getElementsByClassName(namesString)`
*   The above methods return a **live** [HTMLCollection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection).
*   Although it's pretty cool that the returned list is automatically updated to include/exclude DOM elements as the DOM is updated, the above methods are not as flexible as the `querySelectorAll` method...

### [](#selecting-multiple-elements-2)Selecting multiple elements
*   Like `querySelector`, the `querySelectorAll(selector)` method uses the power of CSS3 selectors to specify which DOM elements we want returned.
*   Of course, like the name says, it selects **all** DOM elements that match the _selector_.
*   By itself, `querySelectorAll` actually provides all the DOM selection power a web dev needs!

### [](#select-multiple-elements-withbrspan-styletext-transform-lowercasequeryspansspan-styletext-transform-lowercaseelectorspanaspan-styletext-transform-lowercasellspan)Select multiple elements with querySelectorAll
*   üí™ **You Do:** Use `querySelectorAll` to select all of the elements with a class of `comment` and assign to a variable named `commentEls`.
*   `console.log(commentEls)` to verify it worked.

### [](#dom-selection-summary)DOM Selection Summary
*   In summary, use the following to help you decide which method to use to select DOM elements:
    *   **getElementById**: Use when you need to select a single element that has an `id` assigned to it.
    *   **querySelector**: Use when you need to select a single element that **does not** have an `id`.
    *   **querySelectorAll**: Use when you need to select multiple elements.

### [](#iterating-over-a-collection-of-elements)Iterating over a collection of elements
*   `querySelectorAll` returns an array-like object called a [NodeList](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeList).
*   There are three approaches we can use to iterate over the elements in a _NodeList_ :
    *   A regular **`for`** loop - works, but is not as readable or elegant...
    *   The **`forEach`** method. A good option when you want to iterate through _all_ elements and also want to access the **index** of the iteration.
    *   A **`for of`** loop - elegant and allows early exit of the loop with the `break` statement, however, does not have access to an **index** (although you could track indexes manually by initializing a separate variable before the loop and incrementing it within the loop).

### [](#iterating-over-a-collection-of-elements-1)Iterating over a collection of elements
*   Let's type this `for...of` loop in the console to log each element:

    for(let commentEl of commentEls) {
      console.log(commentEl);
    }
    
*   üí™ **You Do:** Add a `for...of` loop to `script.js` that changes the font size all of the comment elements to 30px.
*   Hint: You must use a string like `'30px'` (just the number `30` or the string of `'30'` will not work).

### [](#-final-questions)‚ùì Final Questions
1.  **What method is the most efficient for selecting an element that has an `id`?**
2.  **If we want to insert content in an element that includes markup, what property would we assign to?**
3.  **If you had to pick only one method to select DOM elements with during your career as a developer, which one should you choose?**
4.  **Which property on DOM elements is used to set the CSS properties for that element?**
